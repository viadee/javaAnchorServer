This is a server to provide Anchor-Explanations for machine learning models. 
It uses the [Java implementation of anchors](https://github.com/viadee/javaAnchorExplainer) 
as well as [adapters](https://github.com/viadee/javaAnchorAdapters) for accessing the data from an H2O server 
and optionally distributing the execution on a spark cluster. 
In conjunction with [javaAnchorFrontend](https://github.com/viadee/javaAnchorFrontend) an explanation can be created and
viewed easily, efficiently and fast:

A description how to read this table can be found in the [ReadMe of javaAnchorFrontend](https://github.com/viadee/javaAnchorFrontend).

At this point, only access to data from the H2O and its models is supported. How this can be extended is described in [...].

The project is modular and each area can be easily replaced. It is also possible to extend the application so that it does not act as a server but as a command line application.

## Structure
The project is divided into 3 main parts:
- Access: api
- Business
- Access to data: dao
- Execution of the anchor algorithm: anchor

### Access
In the current version, access is via REST. 
This task is performed by the controller module. 
It accepts a request, extracts the required data from the request, and forwards the order to the business layer (business module).
